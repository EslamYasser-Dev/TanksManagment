# Getting Started with Industria Monitorng app.

## introduction

this web app is a small part from a huge Internet of things project aims to make tanks monitoring at factories and whole industrial areas more reliable and safe, by using most recent Internet of things tecnologies (IoT)
via real sensors and modules and using both Edge Computing to make some nessiasry process on chip then
move it via carrier network as Blutooth Low energy(BLE), WiFi(2.4GHZ), send data via robust Gateways then to a WAN
to servers to do some cloud computing and data-analysis.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
